RULES:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

THOUGHTS:
- make it run at 60fps? so there are 60 'ticks' per second
- what the fuck do i use to render the graphics
  -> try tigr on windows, if that doesn't work either then just try something else

PARALLEL THOUGHTS:
- parallel by default
- command line option for serial
